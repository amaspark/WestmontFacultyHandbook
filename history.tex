\subsection{History}

   Early evangelical Christian institutions of higher learning were conceived to
   witness to and to preserve the viability of a world-view understood in light
   of Christian faith and tradition. Many were founded primarily for the
   training of ministers, missionaries, and teachers.

   The Bible Missionary Institute, established in 1937 in Los Angeles, was the
   direct antecedent to Westmont. It was founded by Mrs. Alexander Kerr who
   envisioned a college for training men and women for full-time Christian
   service, especially young people without the resources to attend existing
   institutions.

   In 1940 Westmont College was incorporated as a four-year degree-granting
   Christian liberal arts college. Having outgrown its Los Angeles facilities,
   the campus was relocated to the Dwight Murphy estate in Montecito in 1945.
   Forty acres of the adjacent Deane School were added in 1967. Westmont was
   accredited by WASC in 1958. (For a discussion of the early history of
   Westmont College, see Nancy Phinney's
