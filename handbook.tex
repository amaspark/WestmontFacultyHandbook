% \section{ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL POLICIES OF INTEREST TO THE FACULTY}
% 	\subsection{Emergency Closing}
% 	\subsection{Keys}
% 		Keys to one's office and the building in which it is located are distributed through the Physical Plant office.  Requests for keys are made through the departmental secretary; acknowledgment of receipt of keys must be signed by the faculty member on a form provided by the Physical Plant Department.  When one leaves the employ of Westmont College keys must be returned to the Physical Plant Department.  Keys may not be duplicated without the express consent of the Physical Plant Department.
% 	\subsection{Post Office/Mail}

% 		Mail for students must bear the MS\# of each student. This data can be obtained from the students themselves, from the Student Directory, from the campus switchboard (dial "0"), or by calling the Post Office (x6078).

% 		Mail to be metered for outbound US mail must be brought to the Post Office by 3pm daily. Already-stamped mail can be placed in the mail slots as late as 4pm. During the school year, each department will receive a daily delivery of incoming mail in the late morning, and a daily pickup of outgoing mail in the early to mid-afternoon.

% 		Hours:  Monday -- Friday, 10:00 am - 4:00 pm; Saturday 10:00 am -- 12 noon (package pick-up only)
% 	\subsection{Bulletin Boards}
% 	\subsection{Telephones}
% 		Telephone service, including voice mail, is provided for each office and department for conducting College and professional business.  Long distance calling is available through the use of assigned access codes.  The department chair reviews long distance statements for accuracy and identification of personal long-distance calls placed with access codes.  Reimbursement for personal long-distance calls are made directly to the Business Office and are credited to the department telephone account.  A Faculty and Staff Directory is published once per year with a supplemental quick reference card published shortly after the beginning of each regular semester.  Directories include personal information and are solely for the business and personal use of the Westmont community.  They are not to be used for personal or commercial solicitation and their transfer or sale is prohibited.  Prior year directories should be shredded when they are no longer needed.
% 	\subsection{Purchase Orders/Requisitions}
% 		Purchase Orders and Requisitions are made on forms available from the Department Chair.  Purchases must be approved by the Department Chair and the Provost's office.
% 	\subsection{Professional Development Funds}
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
% 			\item{\underline{Principle}:  Professional Development Funds encourage scholarly work and professional involvement by guaranteeing an annual allotment of money for membership in professional organizations, journal subscriptions and travel to local or regional meetings.  In addition, supplementary funds are made available once a year for active participation in one's scholarly organizations.
% 			}
% 			\item{\underline{Policy}:
% 				\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
% 					\item{Annual Allotment:
% 						\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
% 							\item{A fixed amount will be allocated at the beginning of each year, to each full-time faculty member.
% 							}
% 							\item{A fraction of that amount will be allocated to faculty members with less than a full-tim
% 							}
% 							\item{e load but more than half-time, in proportion to their loads.
% 							}
% 							\item{An expense report must document transportation, registration fees, and any other incurred expense.
% 							}
% 							\item{Faculty may accumulate up to three times the annual allocation.
% 							}
% 						\end{enumerate}
% 					}
% 					\item{Additional Stipends:
% 						\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
% 							\item{Faculty will be allocated an additional stipend each year for reading a paper, leading a session, or participating as a member of an organizational ruling body.  Requests for additional stipends are made to the Provost.
% 							}
% 							\item{No more than one such additional stipend will be granted each year except under unusual circumstances.
% 							}
% 						\end{enumerate}
% 					}
% 					\item{Requests for all payment should be submitted to the Provost's office.
% 					}
% 				\end{enumerate}
% 			}
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\subsection{Motor Vehicles on Campus}

% 		Parking permits are required and are available free of charge from Campus Security.  County regulations prohibit faculty members from parking motor vehicles on campus without valid parking permits.  Parking permits must be affixed to one's vehicle in accordance with instructions.  If faculty bring substitute vehicles to campus without permits (e.g., rental car), they are to obtain temporary permits from the physical plant or the housing office.  Faculty operating vehicles found in violation of these regulations will receive an initial warning and then face fines for each occurrence, vehicle immobilization, and/or towing of the vehicle at the owner's expense.  Faculty may park in any parking lot; the Kerr Student Center lot is specifically reserved for faculty and staff during regular office hours.  Faculty should respect ``Reserved'' areas and short interval time zones during regular hours.

% 		Faculty members are expected to abide by all parking and traffic regulations described in the Vehicle regulations brochure and web site.  While violations will be subject to fines as described in the Regulations, fines may be appealed to the Office of Public Safety, and then to Faculty Council.  Faculty members who find that a parking regulation interferes with their teaching duties should address their concerns to Faculty Council, who will work with them and Public Safety to mitigate the difficulty.  Public Safety may also convey concerns about excessive faculty violations to Faculty Council.
% 	\subsection{Check-Cashing}
% 		Personal checks up to \$25.00 may be cashed at the Bookstore during regular hours.
% 	\subsection{ Athletic Events and Facilities}
% 		Upon presenting a College identification card, a faculty member and immediate family members have free admittance to all home athletic events except play-off games.  Contact the Athletic Department for a schedule of sporting events.  Lockers are available by contacting the Athletic Trainer's office.  Faculty and their immediate families may use the swimming pool, track, tennis courts, racquetball courts, exercise room, and gym when those facilities are open and not being used for scheduled events.
% 	\subsection{ Dining Commons/The Study}
% 		Meals may be purchased at the Dining Commons (the ``DC'').  Snacks and meals are also available from ``The Study'' located in the same building as the DC.  The DC and ``The Study'' accept cash or prepaid ``munch money'' which may be purchased at a discount from the food services contractor at the DC.  The Study (not the DC) accepts Visa and MasterCard, which can be used to purchase ``Munch Money.''  Additional information can be found at www.westmont.eduauxsvcs and www.westmontdining.com.
% 	\subsection{ Bookstore}
% 		All faculty purchases, except textbooks and special-order books, are eligible
% 		for a 10\% discount.  Departmental charges are discounted 15\%.

% \section{STUDENT AFFAIRS POLICIES OF INTEREST TO THE FACULTY}
% 	\subsection{Student Handbook (appended)}
% 	\subsection{Student Conduct Code}
% 	\subsection{Family Educational Rights and Responsibilities}
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
% 			\item{Under the ``Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974'' the faculty are responsible to maintain privacy of academic information for each student.  In agreement with the provisions of this law the College has established the guidelines regarding access to student information.  In particular, the College has decided that only the academic advisor of a given student may see the student's academic record.  Parents have access to that record only if the son or daughter is financially dependent upon them.  Questions regarding the implementation of the law at Westmont College should be directed to the Registrar; the Director of Financial Aid is responsible for assessing the financial dependence of students upon parents.
% 			}

% 			\item{Of particular importance to faculty is the proscription under FRPA of the posting of student grades where the students are identified by name, social security number or student identification number, or by any other means which can lead with modest effort to the identification of student with grade.  Students may be asked to provide a coded identification at the beginning of the course which may then be used legally for the posting of grades.
% 			}
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\subsection{Student Discipline Code}
% 		The faculty are responsible for setting and maintaining standards for student conduct in academic work.  All other aspects of student behavior are under the aegis of the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students and the Student Life Staff.  Often, disciplinary actions by the student life office has academic consequences; faculty are not permitted to modify its action by, for example, providing opportunities for making up work missed because of suspension.  The established appeal process for the student is first to the Student Life and Development Committee and then to the President of the College.
% 	\subsection{Rights and Responsibilities}
% 		By virtue of enrollment at Westmont College the student is entitled to certain rights among which are:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
% 			\item{a clear statement of the expectations for each course and the means of evaluation to be used; this is provided in the course syllabus which the instructor distributes at the beginning of the semester, a copy of which is kept in the office of the Provost; the syllabus should be viewed as a contract which may be modified only by the common consent of the faculty member and those students enrolled in the course;
% 			}
% 			\item{access to the faculty member outside of class during announced office hours;
% 			}
% 			\item{unbiased evaluation;
% 			}
% 			\item{free but limited classroom expression of perspectives on topics germane to the course;
% 			}
% 			\item{protection against the excessive inclusion of materials which are not related to the course. Judgments of relevance are to be made in light of the mission of Westmont as a Christian liberal arts college.
% 			}
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\subsection{Sponsorship/Organizations}

% \section{EXTERNAL RELATIONS POLICIES OF INTEREST TO THE FACULTY}
% 	\subsection{Communications and Publications}
% 		The Public Affairs office provides assistance in developing brochures,
% 		distributing press releases, advertising events, and ordering stationery
% 		and business cards. Staff members also produce the Westmont magazine,
% 		We-Mail, the Faculty Guide, and the fall and spring events calendars.
% 		They serve as a liaison between journalists participating in ProfNet
% 		searches and Westmont faculty. Contact the office at
% 		\underline{pubaffairs@westmont.edu}.
% 	\subsection{Grants Policy}
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
% 			\item{\underline{Grants from Private
% 					Foundations}:  All grant applications made to private foundations must be processed through Westmont College.  This requirement, and the steps outlined below, is necessitated by the need by the College to determine priorities as it makes requests and to ensure oversight of approved faculty projects by the Provost, in consultation with the Office of College Advancement.
% 				\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
% 					\item{Approval to make a grant application
% 						must be secured first from
% 						the office of the Provost by
% 						completing the Intent to
% 						Apply for Extramural Funding
% 						form accessed online through
% 						the Provost's webpage under
% 						Faculty Development.}
% 					\item{The faculty member will, in most
% 						cases, draft and submit the
% 						grant proposal.}
% 				\end{enumerate}
% 			}
% 			\item{\underline{Grants from Governmental Agencies}:  Grant applications seeking funding from governmental and quasi-governmental agencies (e.g., the National Science Foundation) are governed by regulations and policies specific to the funding sources. These applications are processed through the office of the Provost.
% 			}
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\subsection{Patent/Copyright Policy}

% 		Unauthorized use of trademarked names or symbols, including Westmont's, is
% 		prohibited.  Where College resources are used, the College retains ownership
% 		of all faculty, staff and student inventions and other intellectual property
% 		that may be patented, copyrighted, trademarked or licensed for commercial
% 		purposes.

% 		Faculty use of copyrighted material is governed by applicable U.S.
% 		copyright law.  Federal copyright law applies to all forms of
% 		information, including electronic communications.  Violations of
% 		copyright laws include, but are not limited to, making unauthorized
% 		copies of any copyrighted material (including software, text, images,
% 		audio, and video), and displaying or distributing copyrighted materials
% 		over computer networks without the author's permission except as
% 		provided in limited form by copyright fair use restrictions.  The ``fair
% 		use'' provision of the copyright law allows for limited reproduction and
% 		distribution of published works without permission for such purposes as
% 		criticism, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for
% 		classroom use), scholarship, or research.  Copyright guidelines,
% 		available from the College Bookstore, are outlined in ``Questions and
% 		Answers on Copyright for the Campus Community'' (National Association of
% 		College Stores and the Association of American Publishers, 1997).

% 	\subsection{Use of Institutional Letterhead, Trademarks, Tradenames}
% 		The logo, letterhead, and other insignia of the College are approved by the President.  College insignia or other identifying symbols should be used only for official business on behalf of the College.  Private use of College symbols and stationery that might imply institutional endorsement of a faculty member's activities must first receive approval of the Provost.
% 	\subsection{Political Activity}
% 		As an academic institution Westmont College maintains a non-partisan position and ensures the freedom of faculty as citizens to engage in political speech and activities so far as they are able to do so consistent with their obligations as teachers and scholars.  However, when speaking or acting as private citizens, faculty must avoid creating the impression they are doing so for the College.
% 	\subsection{Fundraising}
% 		College fundraising activities are conducted through the Office of College Advancement.  Individual fundraising efforts by faculty may be conducted only with the express approval of the Vice President for Development.

% \section{EXCEPTIONS IN APPLICATION OF POLICY}
% 	It is understood that the provisions of this \emph{Faculty Handbook} cannot take into account all possible circumstances that might suggest alternatives in the application of policies related to the faculty, the Provost may grant an exception for a policy at his or her discretion based on a request from a faculty member, with the approval of the faculty member affected.  Faculty members may talk with the Provost at any point regarding the application of a policy when they feel that personal circumstance may call for an exception.
