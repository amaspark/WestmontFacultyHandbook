	\subsection{Proposing Changes}
		\subsubsection{Technical Mechanism for Changes}
			Using the features of github, it is possible to submit changes
			directly to the source text of this document by editting
			it online. To accomplish this,
			navigate to the website identified in Figure \ref{fig:qr_repo} and
			edit the files that end in ``.tex''

			Such edits will be noted as proposed changes and are called ``pull requests'' by github.
			The changes will need to be voted on by the Faculty Council before the pull request will be accepted, thus changing the document.

			Alternatively, one can open an ``issue'' on the website to propose a change in general terms.  The issue has its own
			comment thread.

			Once the changes are approved via a formal process, the document must be typeset and submitted to the repository for distribution.
